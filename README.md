## Project Objectives Achieved :
1. Built a robot model using SolidWorks and exported it as URDF. 
2. Added LiDAR Sensor on to the robot and visualized it (LiDAR points) in RViz. 
3. Performed teleop and moved the toycar around in Gazebo. 
4. Coded up a simple publisher and subscriber for robot so that it moves ahead in a circular loop for 10~15 seconds.
