# CAD-modelling-and-simulation-of-Toy-Car-Robot-using-Gazebo
Project Goals :
1. Build  a  specific  robot  model  on  SolidWorks  and  export  it  as  URDF. 
2. Adding LiDAR Sensor on to the robot and showing its visualization (LiDAR points) in RViz. 
3. Performing  teleop  and  moving the toycar around  in  the  map in Gazebo. 
4. Coded up a simple publisher and subscriber for robot so that it moves ahead in a circular loop for 10~15 seconds.
