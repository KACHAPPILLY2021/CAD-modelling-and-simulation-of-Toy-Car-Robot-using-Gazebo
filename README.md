# CAD-modelling-and-simulation-of-Toy-Car-Robot-using-Gazebo
Project Goals :
1. Build  a  specific  robot  model  on  SolidWorks  and  export  it  as  URDF. 
2. Add LiDAR Sensor on to your robot and show your visualization (LiDAR points) in RViz. 
3. Perform  t eleop  and  move  around  in  the  map in Gazebo. 
4.  Code up a simple publisher and subscriber for your robot so that it moves ahead in a straight line or  circular loop for 10~15 seconds.
